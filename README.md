# Next-Gen-Multikey-Encryption-A-Hybrid-Model-for-Video-Security
This project implements a hybrid cryptographic system for secure video file encryption using multiple AES keys in parallel. It also integrates Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for digital signature generation and verification to ensure authenticity and integrity.
